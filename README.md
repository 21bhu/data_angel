<a id="introduction"></a>
Bellabeat, founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, is a leading company in health-focused smart products. Sršen, leveraging her artistic background, has created elegant technology that helps women monitor and improve their health by tracking activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health. Since its founding in 2013, Bellabeat has rapidly grown and established itself as a key player in women\'s wellness technology.

By 2016, Bellabeat had expanded globally, launching multiple products and making them available through various online retailers and their own e-commerce platform. The company’s marketing strategy includes traditional advertising such as radio and billboards, but it predominantly focuses on digital channels. Bellabeat invests in Google Search, maintains active social media profiles on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and uses YouTube and Google Display Network for video and display ads.

To further its growth, Sršen has directed the marketing analytics team to analyze smart device usage data. The objective is to understand how consumers are using Bellabeat’s products and to use these insights to develop strategic recommendations for enhancing Bellabeat’s marketing efforts.
